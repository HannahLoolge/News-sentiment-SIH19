First Chinese Metro rake to arrive on February 5

The 107.42-metre long MV Han Zhang that left the Shanghai port <a class=""key_underline"" href=""https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/on-February-5"">on February 5</a> with eight coaches of the state-of-the-art rake stopped at Chittagong and is now on its way to the anchorage at Sandheads, about 223km from Kolkata.

<br/><br/>“The Hong Kong-flag vessel is expected to enter the Kolkata Dock System (KDS) of KoPT either on Sunday evening or early on Monday. The ship is carrying the rake weighing 364 tonnes. The coaches will be unloaded by the ship’s own cranes that have a capacity of 200 tonnes,” a KoPT official said.
<div class=""last8brdiv""></div><br/><div class=""last7brdiv""></div><br/><div class=""image"" data-msid=""68227045""><img alt=""1"" src=""https://static.toiimg.com/img/68227045/Master.jpg""/></div><div class=""last6brdiv""></div><br/>This is the first time that a rake for the Metro Railway is arriving by sea. In fact, this is the first time that a rake for use in Kolkata is being imported. Officials are eagerly awaiting the arrival of the rakes from China as they would augment capacity and allow Metro to phase out older ones that are well past their operational lives. Metro Railway has ordered 14 rakes from Dalian and one of them is expected to reach Kolkata every month after the arrival of the first one.
<div class=""last5brdiv""></div><br/><div class=""last4brdiv""></div><br/>“The rakes will use the port’s railway link to enter the <a class=""key_underline"" href=""https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/indian-railways"">Indian Railways</a> system. It will then reach Dum Dum and cross over to the Metro tracks. In the past, rakes manufactured at ICF, Chennai, and elsewhere have been brought to Kolkata by rail. Even the last two rakes from ICF were hauled to Kolkata by locomotives. Rakes for the East-West Metro corridor arrived by road as they are standard gauge ones and can’t run on broad gauge tracks. The rake from China is coming well covered to prevent any damage and these will only be removed at the carshed. The wheels and undercarriages have been left free to allow haulage,” Metro Railway CPRO Indrani Banerjee said.
<div class=""last3brdiv""></div><br/><div class=""last2brdiv""></div><br/>Unloading the rake will also be a tricky job for port authorities as the coaches will have to be gently lowered on to the railway tracks and then coupled. This is the first time that the port is handling such cargo.

Rajdhani Express 50th birthday treat for passengers
</span>",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/rajdhani-50th-birthday-treat-for-passengers/articleshow/68209484.cms,"March 01, 2019"," KOLKATA: Indian Railway Catering & Tourism Corporation (IRCTC) plans to pamper passengers of the 12301 Howrah-New Delhi <a class=""key_underline"" href=""https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Rajdhani-Express"">Rajdhani Express</a> as it departs Howrah on Sunday. After all, the passengers will be part of history. The Rajdhani Express, Indian Railways’ first luxury train, will be completing 50 years Sunday. The first Rajdhani of the country ran from Howrah to New Delhi on March 3, 1969.

<br/><br/>And who would better to be in charge of the celebrations than the son of the first Rajdhani’s catering inspector Ratan Chandra Chandra, who passed away in 2016. His son Debashis Chandra is now the group general manager (east), IRCTC. He has promised to make the journey a memorable one for the passengers.
<br/><br/><div class=""image"" data-msid=""68213446""><img alt=""old menu"" src=""https://static.toiimg.com/img/68213446/Master.jpg""/></div><br/><br/>“We shall serve fish fry or vegetable cutlets to AC-II and AC-III tier passengers. There will also be rosogollas for dessert, apart from the regular ice cream. First AC passengers will have a continental menu with fish fry or vegetable cutlet and the special caramel custard that used to be part of the menu at one time. We shall also welcome all passengers with chocolates and roses,” Chandra said.
<br/><br/>In 1969, <a class=""key_underline"" href=""https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Indian-Railways"">Indian Railways</a> was not only experimenting with a high-speed luxury train but also with the concept of clubbing meal charges with ticket fares. The instructions were clear. Passengers had to be fed well. 
<br/><div class=""last8brdiv""></div><br/>With no clear instructions, it was left to the senior Chandra to fix the menu in a way that no item was repeated. He soon realized that First AC passengers preferred continental meals and he carefully picked chefs to prepare the food. 
<div class=""last7brdiv""></div><br/><div class=""last6brdiv""></div><br/>When dissatisfied, Chandra would cook the meals himself. 
<div class=""last5brdiv""></div><br/><div class=""last4brdiv""></div><br/>“During those days, Rajdhani passengers were considered elite and no slip-up was tolerated. The train had a lounge car and chair cars then. Coolies weren’t allowed into the train and coach attendants would carry passengers’ luggage to their seats. Apart from other items, passengers would be served fish a la Kiev, vegetable au gratin and pudding. My father would never compromise. If he came to know that a passenger didn’t like fish, he would get chicken cutlets prepared for them. He would also carry fresh fruit in the pantry car and serve surprises like mango soufflé. This concept was later picked up by the Mumbai Rajdhani that started in 1972,” Chandra added. 
<div class=""last3brdiv""></div><br/><div class=""last2brdiv""></div><br/>Though Rajdhanis are still considered premier trains, there has been a sea change in the quality of service. Even the fish fry, served on the Howrah Rajdhani that passengers swore by, was discontinued a few years ago. Chandra said efforts are on revive some of the train’s lost glory by bringing about changes in the menu.

Govt flags Railways' steel import plans, says ‘make in India’
</span>",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/govt-flags-railways-steel-import-plans-says-make-in-india/articleshow/68144037.cms,"February 24, 2019"," NEW DELHI: The steel ministry has red-flagged Indian Railways’ plan to import rails, arguing that domestic manufacturers should be given preference and the state-run transporter should work out a long-term strategy for local production, which is the government’s thrust under PM Narendra Modi’s ‘Make in India’ scheme. 

<div class=""last8brdiv""></div><br/><div class=""last7brdiv""></div><br/>This is the second time in two years that the railways’ import plans are facing scrutiny after the Modi administration put in place a public procurement policy that gives preference to domestically-produced goods. After placing an order to import an estimated five lakh tonnes for the current financial year, the railways has sought an exemption from the government order for afour lakh tonne order to meet its requirement for next year. 
<div class=""last6brdiv""></div><br/><div class=""last5brdiv""></div><br/>Against its requirement of 14 lakh tonnes for the current financial year, the railways has estimated that it will need 17 lakh tonnes next year. State-run SAIL has a capacity to produce 12 lakh tonnes while JSPL can manufacture another 6 lakh tonnes of rails, prompting fresh resistance from the steel ministry, sources told TOI. 
<div class=""last4brdiv""></div><br/><div class=""last3brdiv""></div><br/>The ministry has now sought details from railways, with sources indicating that the transporter needs to disclose its longterm strategy for expansion of tracks and renewal of existing ones so that adequate capacity is created in the country. 
<div class=""last2brdiv""></div><br/><div class=""last1brdiv""></div><br/>“Every country that has done this kind of work has relied on local manufacturers. If needed, SAIL can work with railways and plan its capacity augmentation, including a possible joint venture with railways,” said a source. On its part, the railways believes that there is a shortage of manufacturing capacity and supply needs to be augmented via imports.

1 in works, railways to study 10 more bullet train corridors

<br/><br/>The transporter has already moved a proposal to seek Cabinet approval, which includes permission to carry out a feasibility study and a detailed project report for the 10 possible <a class=""key_underline"" href=""https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/bullet-train"">bullet train</a> corridors. Segments on the radar include Delhi-Mumbai, Delhi-Kolkata, Delhi-Amritsar, Patna-Kolkata and Chennai-Bengaluru. Sources said these will require investment of about Rs 10 lakh crore over 10 years. “This plan is very preliminary,” a source told TOI.
<br/><br/>Currently, there is one high-speed train corridor — Ahmedabad-Mumbai — under implementation.
<br/><br/><div class=""image"" data-msid=""68119973""><img alt=""rail"" src=""https://static.toiimg.com/img/68119973/Master.jpg""/></div><br/><br/>The immediate focus is on adding 17,000km to the existing 1.2 lakh km rail network, which will entail an investment of over Rs 5 lakh crore and will be funded through extra-budgetary borrowings, sources familiar with the plan told TOI. The plan involves trebling the rail tracks along the Golden Quadrilateral and other lines with the objective being to win back traffic from roads.
<br/><br/>Separately, three new freight corridors have been discussed on the lines of the Delhi-Mumbai and Amritsar-Kolkata DFCs.
<br/><br/>It has been proposed that a large chunk of funding for these projects could come from multilateral funding agencies such as the <a class=""key_underline"" href=""https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/World-Bank"">World Bank</a>, JICA and the Asian Development Bank.
<br/><br/><strong>‘Rail-on-rail’ flyovers to decongest junctions<br/></strong><br/>Railway ministry officials said there is a three-pronged strategy to augment the capacity of railways and increase its network. The National Rail Capacity Augmentation Plan, or Rail Vistaar Pariyojna, will focus on increasing the carrying capacity for both passengers and freight, particularly to increase the share of freight transported thro- ugh railways, to 45-50% as compared to the current trend of 30%.
<br/><br/>The tripling of Jalgaon-Wardha, Guddur-Chennai and Mumbai-Chennai would be undertaken. Another 14 sections on other highly utilised network routes would be covered under this project. The total tripling is estimated to be 4,286km.
<div class=""last8brdiv""></div><br/><div class=""last7brdiv""></div><br/>In its bid to decongest major junctions, the railways has also prepared a blueprint of building “rail-on-rail” flyovers and bypasses at 222 locations. Railway minister <a class=""key_underline"" href=""https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Piyush-Goyal"">Piyush Goyal</a> had recently said a roadmap is being prepared for this.
<div class=""last6brdiv""></div><br/><div class=""last5brdiv""></div><br/>After eliminating all unmanned crossings, the next big step would be eliminating the 7,000 manned crossings with rail overbridges and rail underbridges.
<div class=""last4brdiv""></div><br/><div class=""last3brdiv""></div><br/>All these works would require about Rs 5.7 lakh crore and the government estimates these works will generate 9.6 lakh jobs and will also push the demand for cement and steel to the tune of 21 lakh tonnes in each case.

</span>",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/railways-rolls-out-tech-to-track-phones-and-gold-stolen-on-trains/articleshow/68040241.cms,"February 18, 2019"," MUMBAI: For the first time for <a class=""key_underline"" href=""https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/indian-railways"">Indian Railways</a>, a dedicated cyber cell is coming up in Mumbai where the RPF will use technology to probe theft and track down touts involved in unauthorized ticket booking. The cell, being set up by Western Railway, will likely be at <a class=""key_underline"" href=""https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Mumbai-Central"">Mumbai Central</a> and have an RPF staff of 28. 

<br/><br/><div class=""image"" data-msid=""68041136""><img alt=""1"" src=""https://static.toiimg.com/img/68041136/Master.jpg""/></div><br/>Passengers on premium trains like the Rajdhani are more vulnerable to high-value theft. Such passengers include traders carrying precious stones or people carrying ornaments. On long-distance trains leaving Mumbai at night, thefts are reported more frequently in Gujarat and MP as passengers fall asleep by the time their train enters these states. 
<br/><br/>In many instances, culprits turn out to be co-travellers from the same coach holding a valid ticket. “Organized groups are involved in high-value theft. 
<br/><div class=""last8brdiv""></div><br/>Last February, we busted four members of a Haryana gang for stealing jewellery and cash worth Rs 14 lakh from an NRI traveller's bag at Vadodara station,” said a crime branch officer. 
<div class=""last7brdiv""></div><br/><div class=""last6brdiv""></div><br/>The foursome had offered help to the traveller to move her bags. During investigation, officers spotted on <a class=""key_underline"" href=""https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/CCTV"">CCTV</a> footage a man moving suspiciously at the station, which led to the bust. “Identifying suspects on CCTV footage isn't simple as one needs to study every frame in multiple videos. Cyber cell officers would be trained in what to look out for. Dossiers will be compiled on organized gangs,” said a senior officer. 
<div class=""last5brdiv""></div><br/><div class=""last4brdiv""></div><br/>Mobile device forensics, including call data record (CDR) analysis and how to track a number from cellphone tower dump data, will be the prime focus of the cyber cell (see graphic for details). Cyber cell officers will also be trained on analyzing IP addresses, studying ticket booking data to analyze booking patterns and bank information analysis to track down touts. 
<div class=""last3brdiv""></div><br/><div class=""last2brdiv""></div><br/>Unauthorized sale of tickets peaks in the holiday season. “Online booking starts at 8am and the highest chances of illegal software being used by touts occur in the next few minutes. Studying booking data is cumbersome, but the IP address or bank account used for booking serves as evidence in court,” an officer said.
